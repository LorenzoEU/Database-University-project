# Database-University-project
This project aims to build a relational database using SQL to create a support network for schools involved in school garden projects. 
The DBMS used is PostreSQL.

`The Domain specifications and the tasks are in files **"Domain specifications And targets"**, in italian, as provided, and translated in english. 

The constraints of the ER-Schema are listed in **"Constraints"** file. Only check-type constraints are implemented in SQL.

Relational Schema is easily viewable in the **"DataGrip"** file.
Relational Schema is implemented and populated in **"2.4 SchemaPopolato.sql"** file. In that file there are also the requested queries.`
